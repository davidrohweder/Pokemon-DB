# Version Beta

# Abstract
Universal Windows runnable exe without any software dependencies to execute. Self contained files only needing the accdb file to be in the same directory as the .exe file. 

Made for my friend who had a lot of cards and needed a way to inventory them, future usage might pull api data for more stat analysis.
